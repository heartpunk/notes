- Reading up on a RC zulip thread about primary backup versus replicated state machines and I found [this nice quick summary](https://jaksa.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/active-and-passive-replication-in-distributed-systems/) as well as [this paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/viveLaDifference.pdf), which in section 2.2, summarizes the differences.
  - The essential difference is this: a replicated state machine (also called active replication) is a system where all nodes (or at least a quorum, I assume) receive all operations, use a consensus algorithm to agree on ordering, and then independently apply those operations. A primary backup system uses leader election to pick a primary, which receives all operations, performs all of them, and then sends state deltas to backups, which then apply them independently.
  - There's also a latency and bandwidth usage tradeoff, where RSMs win. OTOH, a PB setup can work with nondeterministic operations.
- Watched [a talk on lasp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wjwIRrDhI) given at the ACM by [cmeik](https://twitter.com/cmeik). Then [tweeted back and forth with him](https://twitter.com/tehgeekmeister/status/772420609917784064), and learned some cool stuff!
- [Deconstructing Criticism](http://malcolmocean.com/2016/08/deconstruction-of-criticism/) is a nice post about the nuances of feedback and criticism, and when it's likely to be useful. Short and sweet summary:
  - Feedback can be negative or positive.
  - Criticism is generally negative.
  - Not all negative feedback is criticism â€“ whether the intent is to help or not is the primary distinction.
  - Feedback (or criticism) will be met with defensiveness if the relationship is not safe enough.
- Played with [ohm](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/) with Diego a little today. Found a paper on [packrat parsers](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2007002_packrat.pdf) that I'll need to read to understand part of their parse phase explanations, specifically the grow-LR phase. On the whole, it was a pleasant and informative experience playing with it, though.
