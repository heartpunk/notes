<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Mostly worked with Lin on setting up AWS to host her PostGIS data for her timeslice of rain data project. It's surprisingly tedious and finnicky, but I'm glad to be able to help her with it. Otherwise, closing tabs and stuff. Had some kind of cool eggy cake thing from Banh Mi Saigon (where we went for lunch). Presentations are about to start, and then I'm off to a PapersWeLove NYC meeting, on 3d mesh manipulation (I don't think it covers rendering). Got turned down by Jane Street today, before any discussion. Stings a little, but I did sort of expect something like this might happen.</p>

<li>Kyle Littler shared this cool blog post on how <a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1284">reducers are fuzzers</a>, which he described as being about how the process of finding the minimal input that reproduces a bug can sometimes end up finding an instance of another bug. The example is a bit off from what's normally considered a reducer, and kind of weakens the piece rhetorically. For example, he's reducing the token sequence of a valid c++ program, rather than reducing the inputs to a typical program. True, he's trying to find bugs in the compiler, so I guess it's actually analogous, but it will certainly lose some people who might have otherwise understood the post.</li>
<li>Interesting toot that <a href="https://twitter.com/MeLlamoLlama_/status/692699504919867392">summarizes the difference between the perceived nature of the Dunning-Kruger effect versus the actual nature of it</a>.</li>
<li>Learned about the acid debugger, <a href="http://9p.io/sys/doc/acidpaper.html">which there's a paper about</a>, and <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/talks/acid07/">a talk by Russ Cox</a>. It's supposedly a debugger that came out of a programming language (in fact, that's part of the title of the paper). It <a href="http://blog.matttproud.com/2014/08/plan-9s-acid-debugger-and-go.html">seems to have some living remnants in go</a>, though it's originally from Plan 9. There's a <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/inferno/4th_edition/kernel_debugging/">tutorial for it here</a>.</li>
<li>Brian Rice shared this cool <a href="http://tatiyants.com/postgres-query-plan-visualization/">postgres query plan visualizer</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/BrianTRice/status/692470125409222657">tweet here</a>). This is a really good example of visualizing a complex, hidden process. Really like the work overall. <a href="https://github.com/AlexTatiyants/pev">Github repo</a>.</li>
<li>Found out about a <a href="http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/02/27/unlocking_the_secrets_of_new_york_citys_most_famous_model.php">big huge model of NYC at the Queens museum</a>. Pretty damn cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/">C-Reduce</a> is a tool for reducing a c(++) program to a minimal input that satisfies a (verified in the shell) property. Intended for use in reproducing compiler errors. I discovered this while reading the reducers are fuzzers article at the top of this list.</li>
<li>Cool story about <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/a-different-kind-of-doctors-office-patients-pay-directly-keeping-insurance/2262388">direct primary care</a>, which is where the patients pay a primary care doctor directly, a fixed monthly amount. Seems cool!</li>
<li>Randomly learned that [Stephen Cook developed the idea of NP-Completeness from this tweet], which links to <a href="http://4mhz.de/cook.html">this page</a> which hosts an <a href="http://4mhz.de/download.php?file=Cook1971_A4.pdf">A4</a> and <a href="http://4mhz.de/download.php?file=Cook1971_Letter.pdf">letter</a> size version of the paper, transliterated from the original. It's small! I might be able to understand it! I will attempt at some point. Putting in queue.</li>
<li>Just configured <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">vimium</a>, which has some extra documentation <a href="https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/README.md">here</a>, and a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5925220/make-chrome-less-distracting-with-vimium-and-these-settings">lifehacker tutorial here</a>.</li>
<li>Good photo-essay-ish thing <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/D19On">about life in Norilsk, the northernmost city in the world</a>. This is the one that has so much nickel mining that, supposedly, you can extract nickel from the topsoil.</li>
<li>Yesterday I read about <a href="http://www.techinsider.io/spreads-robot-farm-will-open-soon-2016-1">the world's first fully robotic farm</a>.</li>
