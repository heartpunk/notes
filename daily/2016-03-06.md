# Overview

I've been away from this for a few weeks now. Things have been busy. I've piled up thousands of tabs in one tab. I'm okay with this for right now. This is me getting a bit back on the wagon, and because I need to get some things out of my email inbox, and into here.

## Notes
- Some cool quotes from Jade's grandpa.
  - if you build power and don't use it, you can keep it.
  - if you don't use that power when the right situation comes, what's the point?
  - her commentary when I asked if I could put this in public notes: "In case it helps to have it in the notes, they're actually from my grandfather, and they're about standing up for what you believe in, even when you're in a dangerous line of work, like being a journalist for (and later chief editor of) a major newspaper in Communist China. (He was the one who was on death row twice for printing and saying what he wanted.)"
- Some example codasyl stuff is available in [Databases - Role and Structure](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eZo8AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA19&ots=2sMXvngaRz&lr=&pg=PA19&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false)'s Codasyl chapter. This was something that [Martin Kleppman](https://martin.kleppmann.com/) shared with me during his residency at RC. Additionally he shared [IBM's IMS â€“ Myths, Realities, and Opportunities] and [The Programmer as Navigator](http://www.jdl.ac.cn/turing/pdf/p653-bachman.pdf). These both seem like promising reads about how things worked once upon a time.
