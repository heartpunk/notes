Just went to the Metropolitan Museum with Andr√©e and an RC talk today. It was a good day full of good talks. Two interesting ideas were had:

- The connection between accounting as a means of having the life you want and definite optimism, as described in Zero to One by Peter Thiel. Additionally, how definite optimism is very, very often put into practice as modeling and simulation, or thinking from first principles.
- How deciding to provide basic needs to people is extremely complicated, because most needs are related to their social utility, which means there is no clear cut and obvious sense of basic needs. Not that this is irresolvable inherently, but it's definitely hard. Also, how pluralism and the difference between the libertarian desire for negative freedom and the radical left desire for positive freedom make shit all fucking messy.

Oh, one other important note: fucked up my sleep hardcore (or rather, it reached a new crescendo of fuckedness last night). Was up until 8 AM. Trying to fix this by going to bed now (about 1 AM), and sticking to a earlier bedtime again from now on.

Okay, some other quick notes, because I think they're interesting:

- Went to shake shack for the first time today. It's good, portions are small, bacon is undercooked. Not amazed by shake.
- Marvin Minsky died today, which while it's not part of my day, is sort of a big deal.
- I'm losing a lot of games of [Churchill Solitaire](https://medium.com/@DonRumsfeld/at-83-i-decided-to-develop-an-app-dadd4e53d342#.2e7a5vcae). The game is terribly implemented in so many little ways its absurd, but at least the underlying card game itself is fun. Tempted to reimplement it myself so I don't have to use the shit fucking app of theirs.
