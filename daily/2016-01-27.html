<h2>2016-01-27</h2>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Today was mostly interview/job stuff, with a bit of fun and futzing around towards the beginning and end. Had breakfast with Andrée at Blessings, turns out that place is kind of wonderful. Then got recs sent off for RC, and did some more work on the ways of making change problem. I understand why my solution didn't work relatively well now, but I can't explain it quite to my satisfaction, so, I intend to work on that more soon. Went to dinner at Gandhi Indian after that, then went to RC. Once there, helped Lin get set up on AWS, played some undertale, and defused some bombs. That's basically it. Tomorrow, more stuff with Lin, some interview prep, and the making change, I expect.</p>
<p>Should be to bed before 1:30, but just barely.</p>

<ul>
<li>Andrée told me about this Pycon talk by Tom Ballinger called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAitSilLDUA">Terminal Whispering</a>, which she recommends I watch.</li>
<li>YC posted this really surprising (and sort of not) thing about how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAitSilLDUA">they want to do a basic income experiment</a>. I am very seriously considering applying.</li>
<li>Apparently there's a cool haskell thing called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52VsgyexS8Q">hole driven haskell</a>, which seems something between racket and proof assistants. I'm not sure what it is, and I haven't watched it yet, but I've saved it to my to watch list. Recommended on RC Zulip.</li>
<li>Veronica, I think, has repeatedly recommended an article to me that IIRC she described as <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/?utm_source=SFFB">fuck being a maker</a>, and this is what I found when I looked for it. I wonder whether this is it or not, but it seems worth reading anyway.</li>
<li>Benjamin Gilbert recommended (well, mentioned, not sure he read all of it) this <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/276782/">20 part essay on linkers</a>. Saved for later.</li>
<li>Kiril recommended <a href="http://secretscienceclub.blogspot.com/">secret science club</a> and <a href="http://www.nonsensenyc.com/">nonsense nyc</a>. The former looks like a bunch of talks with researchers explaining their work, and the second like a weird arts/culture mailing list thing. Subscribed myself to both.</li>
<li>One final note (added after the below disclaimer). A couple days ago, Lin told me about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Knowledge-Civilization-Aftermath-Cataclysm/dp/0143127047">The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Civilization in the Aftermath of a Cataclysm</a>, which reminded me of this Kevin Kelly post on <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/bootstrapping-t/">Bootstrapping the Industrial Age</a>. Both are about how to restart society if all goes to shit. Pretty cool stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, didn't manage 1:30, but I can get in right after 2:00 at this point, so I'm going for it.</p>
