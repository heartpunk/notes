I haven't done notes for months. This is me giving it a go, getting back into the habit.

### Stuff

- Cool [farnam street post](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/06/the-third-marriage/) about our relationships with work, romance, and ourselves. Makes good points about how important it is to take care of yourself and prioritize yourself.
- Rediscovered some cool books from middle school or so about the history of freedom. Seem a little biased, as I would expect given I got them at church camp, but I'm stoked to perhaps re-read them.
  - [Story of Liberty](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Liberty-Will-Comprehend-Worth/dp/093855820X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1471830921&sr=1-1&keywords=story+of+liberty)
  - [Sweet Land of Liberty](https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Liberty-Charles-Carleton-Coffin/dp/093855848X)
- Diego and I did some cool work on some accounting reconciliation automation stuff in emacs. Afterward, he found this library [reckon](https://github.com/cantino/reckon), for which there's also this [pretty good blog post](http://blog.andrewcantino.com/blog/2013/02/16/command-line-accounting-with-ledger-and-reckon/). This setup only automates the import and categorization side of accounting, not reconciliation (which is much more painful and important), but it's good tooling and good ideas. Here's a linkdump of some other stuff he shared as well:
  - https://github.com/sabren/sixthdev/blob/master/ledger/bofaconvert.py
  - https://github.com/ledger/ledger/wiki/Reconciling
  - https://github.com/quentinsf/icsv2ledger
- Found this cool interview on five different [introductions to philosophy](http://fivebooks.com/interview/nigel-warburton-on-introductions-to-philosophy/). Want to check them all out.
- Self driving {car,plane} reading binge earlier today. It was amazing!
  - [Uber is going driverless in pittsburgh](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-08-18/uber-s-first-self-driving-fleet-arrives-in-pittsburgh-this-month-is06r7on), apparently. This article was just fun, don't remember anything too incredibly revealing in it.
  - [Self flying plane](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/welcome-to-larry-page-s-secret-flying-car-factories) stuff is really fucking cool. There are some like eleven companies working on this? Two funded by larry page alone. In reading this I learned about the [puffin VTOL](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110011311.pdf) concept, which is just fucking fascinating. Holy shit. I want to read the paper, but for now just having the note will do. Also spawned a somewhat tangential thought...
    - Consider technological feasibility analyses to be like flowcharts. If you ever make a decision based on a quantitative factor, like say weight to power ratio of electric engines, then as the technology evolves, the rational decision associated with that data also changes. Basically, if we reify this sort of analysis, we can predict where the world will radically change next *in some cases*. This doesn't address qualitative shifts, such as self driving cars being feasible because of new techniques. OTOH, if we knew the techniques already, and knew they were good enough, but just that they weren't performant enough yet, then we could ballpark what improvement would be necessary, and basically suspend the research, while we wait for those advances to be made.
- Watched [this incredibly badass and uncharacteristic ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia?language=en#t-489010) on how suburbia is a piece of shit. Which is basically what the guy says â€“ "technosis externality clusterfuck." I found this via [why suburbia sucks](http://qz.com/698928/why-suburbia-sucks/), which is also wonderful.
- Sumit mentioned this fascinating paper [Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?](http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html). I may want to check this out later. It's (apparently) not just about whether the world is a computer simulation, but whether it will be necessary for us to create computer simulations of part or all of the world in order to not go extinct.
- Was reading Masters of the Word and remembered that Michael Nielsen had corrected me on some misinformation I had read in it. I managed to recall that this was whether people read silently or not in the past, and dug up a few convincing articles that seem to confirm they likely read much as we do.
  - [The guardian on this](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview27).
