<h2>Miscellany</h2>
<p>Intended to go up to Central Park with Lin, but we bailed before we got there because we wouldn't make it before the sun went down. Had a chat with Bill Killmer about getting a job. Read an animation tutorial. Processed some more of my current tab backlog. Attempted to defuse my first exotic bomb in <a href="http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/">KTANE</a>.</p>

<li><a href="http://mic.com/articles/133298/i-saved-half-of-everything-i-earned-to-build-my-own-fuck-off-fund-this-is-what-happened?utm_source=policymicFB&amp;utm_medium=life&amp;utm_campaign=social#.OGtw7C1pj">these</a> <a href="https://thebillfold.com/a-story-of-a-fuck-off-fund-648401263659#.cqagt2dm9">two</a> articles on the importance of having savings are really good. They're both actually about the intersection of having savings and how that relates to sex work/being a woman/abusive relationships, but the advice is quite general, and there's substantial merit in the pieces as social commentary, fiscal advice entirely aside.</li>
<li>Rediscovered <a href="http://blog.ram.rachum.com/post/2840398276/the-miserable-programmer-paradox">this gem of an essay on how programmers spend most of their time on work they hate</a>. So glad to have found it again. Haven't re-read it yet, but glad to have found it again.</li>
<li><a href="https://acko.net/blog/animate-your-way-to-glory/">A tutorial on animating math/physics concepts</a> that Allie of RC recommended in our critique group. Finished half of this. Learned a ton. This is surprisingly deep, and surprisingly beautiful. Looking forward to finishing the rest tomorrow.</li>
<li>Veronica asked me if she should do something, which reminded me of <a href="http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2015/11/11/should-not/">this wonderful post by Jamie Brandon</a> about should and its limitations. Guess that's worth saving, then.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/cstross/status/691352036256923648">This tweet</a> links to <a href="http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/Reports/KempLancasterPowerCuts201512V3.pdf">this wonderful PDF</a> about what happens when the power goes out for an extended period of time in the 21st century. It's basically absolute chaos.</li>
<li>Discovered this cool book <a href="https://desktopregulatorystate.wordpress.com/">The Desktop Regulatory State</a> which seems to be about the changing landscape of infrastructure and its relationship to power structures. The slogan seems to summarize it well, though I can't say as I haven't read it yet: "The Countervailing Power of Networks and Super-Empowered Individuals". <a href="https://desktopregulatorystate.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/about-this-book/">The about page</a> seems to describe it pretty damn well.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/alicemazzy/status/684381561479905281">This toot</a> by Alice Maz links to these <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/diversity-policies-dont-help-women-or-minorities-and-they-make-white-men-feel-threatened">other</a> <a href="http://status451.com/2015/12/21/totalizing-politics-and-insurance-rackets/">two</a> articles that seem super legit and up my alley. It's the typical stuff about totalizing politics from Meredith Patterson, and I dig that and want to learn more, so I'll be reading them on the subway ride home in a minute.</li>
<li>Pulled a <a href="http://synesthesiam.com/pages/pubs_talks.html">list of papers on psychology of programming</a>, and found a <a href="http://synesthesiam.com/pages/pubs_talks.html">high level one on cognitive architecture as it relates to programming</a>. Seemed like a good starting point, so I added it to my backlog. Found all of this originally through <a href="http://synesthesiam.com/posts/what-makes-code-hard-to-understand.html">What Makes Code Hard to Understand</a>.</li>
