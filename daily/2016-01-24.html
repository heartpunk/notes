<h2>Miscellany</h2>
<p>Mostly spent the day playing games, futzing about online, and out and about with Lin in Prospect Park. There's a snow storm and so most things are shut down. Decided to start this thing of doing notes on things of interest for the day. Will probably also do weekly and monthly rollups. Inspired by being so fucking pissed off about the number of tabs in my browser and my uncertainty about what to do with them, that I just reinstalled onetab, slaughtered them all, and will start to review a few of the backlog daily, and port everything new from each day into here at the end.</p>
<h2>Some Cool Shit</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8ZX1RoWHuiJRnppcERLNjdSV00/edit">Symbiosis - A Provocation About Organizations</a></li>
<li>A cool piece by Michael Feathers about how Conway's Law/the homomorphic principle relates to organizations choosing to identify as software companies that solve a certain kind of problem, or some other kind of company that happens to use software.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pgbovine/rosetta/wiki/Rosetta-design-doc">Rosetta Design Doc</a></li>
<li>Rosetta is (or will be) a grammar for code visualization. Philip Guo/@pgbovine is behind this. Seems like a great project, want to get into it/read up on this.</li>
<li><a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html">The Pinocchio Problem</a></li>
<li>This is a Steve Yegge rant about how a number of properties of software are related both to each other and to overall goodness of software.<ul>
<li>He specifically calls out:</li>
<li>Live upgradability</li>
<li>A command shell</li>
<li>Advice, something like aspect oriented programming, callbacks, or before/after/around hooks.</li>
<li>An extension language</li>
<li>Introspection mechanisms</li>
<li>A plugin system</li>
<li>Additionally he makes a distinction between hardware and software.</li>
<li>Hardware is nailed down and static. Type systems are good for this sense of hardware.</li>
<li>Software is better the more it embodies the properties listed above. It needs to evolve in ways that basically require said features.</li>
<li>Heavily/weirdly related to <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/10/29/crash-only-thinking/">crash only thinking</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%27s_paradox">Quine's Paradox</a></li>
<li>This is a tricky little way of getting around complaints about self-referential/ambiguous language being why the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox">liar's paradox</a> is undecidable (might be misusing that term). Discovered this in misfits slack, it's apparently the origin of Nick's handle. The following is the paradox: "Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine">William Van Orman Quine</a></li>
<li>Known for both Quine's paradox and being the person quines are named after (apparently Douglas Hofstadter is the one who named them after him!). Pretty cool dude, I guess.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/691046812938014721">A hella amusing twitter thread started by the toot "GNU/Linux as a way of avoiding real intimacy".</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.michbar.org/generalinfo/plainenglish/home">The archives of the Plain-English Subcommittee of the State Bar of Michigan</a> have some really, really cool articles on how plain language is perfectly acceptable and even preferable in legal situations. I read <a href="http://www.michbar.org/file/barjournal/article/documents/pdf4article2296.pdf">this one on how legalese and terms of art are often unnecessary</a> as a starter, and intend to read more of them over time.</li>
<li><a href="http://aliceriot.github.io/ast.js/">A cool AST visualization example</a>. I keep hearing about this again and again in zulip/from recursers, might as well be able to find it in the future.</li>
<li><a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/215.html">What's Your Secondary Language</a>. It's a good, short post by James Hague of prog21.dadgum.com on how it is important to have a language for prototyping, and what matters in such a language.</li>
