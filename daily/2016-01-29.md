# Links

Gonna be a lot of links today... Decided I needed to dump all the remaining windows because I had my computer freeze up for about an hour, which is just not worth it. The following is that dump, there'll be another list below this one with today's links (if I have any).

- [Cell phone trees](https://www.nextnature.net/2009/08/antenna-tree-mast-safari/) are cool. Probably found out about this from [the secure transport of light](http://booktwo.org/notebook/the-secure-transport-of-light/), discovered via Katherine Ye.
- [A break down of where telecommunications infrastructure is](http://www.filmandmedia.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/parks/earth-observation.pdf), and probably some other cool stuff. Also probably from secure transport of light.
- Egg Drop Problem
  - [A good statement of it](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22012/index.html).
  - [Another pretty good overview](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-11-egg-dropping-puzzle/).
  - [A recurrence relation approach to solving it](http://spencermortensen.com/articles/egg-problem/).
  - [A little historical note](http://decision-making.moshe-online.com/egg.html) which also points to [a really nice paper on it](http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ited.4.1.48).
  - [The principle of indifference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference) and [regret minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(decision_theory)) both come up repeatedly as explanations of how to solve this.
- In talking about databases, or reading one of her blog posts, Lin linked me to [this thing about data normalization in SQL](http://qntm.org/gay).
- Talking about sudoku solvers, Lin linked me to this [narrative](http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2007/04/learning-from-sudoku-solvers.html?m=1) about Ron Jeffries [succesive](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/oksudoku/) [failed](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/sudoku2/) [attempts](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/sudokumusings/) [to](http://xprogramming.com/articles/sudoku4/) [write](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/sudoku5/) a sudoku solver, as contrasted with [Norvig's short and to the point solution](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html). Also links to an interesting discussion on [whether test drive development is good](https://gigamonkeys.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/coders-unit-testing/).
- [Performance engineering course from MIT](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2010/video-lectures/).
- [On burn out and being all in](http://chrisyeh.blogspot.com/2015/10/youre-not-indispensable-except-when-you.html?m=1&__s=vspfy9ngn73spaueq3i2). This is a comment/response to [Jesse Noller talking about community and boundaries](http://jessenoller.com/blog/2015/10/31/community-boundaries).
- [A video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfWibrh6stw) and [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctyag2Xi8o) and some [slides](http://gts2012.tem.uoc.gr/files/dionysus-slides.pdf) and [a paper](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/barcodes.pdf) and [yet another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bnG1Wavag) and [YET ANOTHER PAPER](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.6437v4.pdf) on persistent homology/topological data analysis.
- [Calculus on computational graphs](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/index.html) is a post I want to get around to reading about some of the underlying stuff behind neural nets. Or so I think it is. [A somewhat related paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952). Probably? This is a brain dump. Don't expect accuracy.
