- Learned (I think again) about the concept of a [chesterton fence](http://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/the-fallacy-of-chestertons-fence/).
- Reviewed two draft blog posts from RC.
  - A biography of how that person got into programming, which inspired me to probably right one. I also found these two others in discussion about the idea of these biographies:
    - [Some random guy's](https://www.mail-archive.com/kragen-tol@canonical.org/msg00184.html).
    - [Tavish Armstrong's](https://github.com/tarmstrong/longcv/blob/master/bio.md), who it turns out is not the person I was thinking of.
  - Another one that made me think about [visualizing program execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml6Dp3F4Inc), which I need to rewatch. This inspired me to track down [the paper that intrigued me the most](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/record-replay-uist2013.pdf) (there's a related [talk](https://vimeo.com/75999901)) out of what was mentioned in the talk, but it turns out [the notes for the talk are amazing](http://janpaulposma.nl/visualising-program-execution/). The concept of the [whyline](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/whyline.html) was the most interesting thing I found while skimming this. It's basically a thing that visualizes the reason any bit of state ended up the way it was, as I understand it from skimming.
- [This tweet](https://twitter.com/derKha/status/772793578447835136) which links to [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/518gcs/whats_your_favorite_piece_of_rust_code/d7a3gs0) reminded me of some similar anecdote that I can't find anymore (though I suspect it was on [prog21.dadgum.com](prog21.dadgum.com)). This introduced me to the [ken thompson hack](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack), which is something about a compiler that can insert a bug into certain kinds of programs, and also propagates the bug generating code to new compilers it compiles. This is supposedly related to [Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf).
- Stumbled across [Knuth's paper that introduces LR parsers](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs48/mxcom/doc/knuth65.pdf).
- From yesterday's reading on deconstructing criticism, I found a link to [this post on causal vs normative explanations](http://malcolmocean.com/2015/10/causal-explanations-vs-normative-explanations/), which was really good. Not really much more to say.
- Adron had a good [blog post about productivity and shiz](http://blog.adron.me/articles/dropping-the-ball-gsd-and-staying-productive/).
- Cool post on [how to copy well](http://robnapier.net/copying), in the context of programming.
- Read up about the grow-LR phase of [packrat parsers with support for left recursion](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2007002_packrat.pdf). Pretty simple, once you learn about it, but it's also entirely unintuitive from the visualizations provided by [ohm](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/).
