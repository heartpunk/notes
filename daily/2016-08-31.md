- Wonderful, weird post on [laws about magical cucumbers](http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/000971.html), from the talmud. Presented in a very silly, irreverant, conversational style.
- Read my first post on this new thing about [paxos without majority consensus](http://hh360.user.srcf.net/blog/2016/08/majority-agreement-is-not-necessary/). I intend to read [this other post](http://ssougou.blogspot.com/2016/08/a-more-flexible-paxos.html) about it later, and maybe even [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06696).
- Cool post about [remote work and why it's not perfect, and not all companies should do it](https://mfbt.ca/why-more-companies-dont-do-remote-work-and-probably-shouldn-t-d8639cf26096#.imce75h3h).
- A really, really cool post about how [the web is awful](https://juniorschematics.com/post/1). It's in the same vein as the [ngnghm](http://ngnghm.github.io) stuff of Fran√ßois Rideau's.
