- [passphraseme](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/) is a cool, simple, self contained passphrase generator. seems secure enough.
- [nice little thing on the progression of an engineer in their career](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/), and the [tweet I found it from](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/).
- wonderful Feynman quote, from this [toot](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/141783-you-have-no-responsibility-to-live-up-to-what-other), and apparently originally from [Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/141783-you-have-no-responsibility-to-live-up-to-what-other).
  - "You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing."
- Awesome example work in Z3 on making a constraint based automatic scheduler. In an [early commit](https://github.com/dmoon1221/scheduler/blob/b749d301823d0dce6d4b66f93098249fde99395d/encoder.py), it was quite slow because of either a large number of constraints (quadratic in the number of activities to schedule), or because of having to use the nonlinear solver. Unclear which, a more self contained test would be interesting. [Later on](https://github.com/dmoon1221/scheduler/blob/b749d301823d0dce6d4b66f93098249fde99395d/encoder.py), this is simplified to a linear number of constraints, and goes much faster, and is also easier to understand. From a thread in zulip.
- Learned about the idea of [coeffects](http://tomasp.net/coeffects/) from [this toot](https://twitter.com/0xabad1dea/status/775142793085915136).
- Really cool collection of [blog posts on PLT/other CS stuff](http://www.felienne.com/archives/category/liveblogging), from [this person](https://twitter.com/felienne). Includes, amusingly enough, a [post about stuff from the same researcher who did the coeffects stuff](http://www.felienne.com/archives/5334)!
  - One of the posts is about [the nature of human language as it relates to kinds of programming errors](http://www.felienne.com/archives/5341), apparently this is from [this paper](http://facsrv.cdm.depaul.edu/~cmiller/research/metonymy-reference-point.pdf). Reminds me of this other [paper](http://elementaryalgebra.cmswiki.wikispaces.net/file/view/Childrens+Difficulties+in+Beginning+Algebra.pdf) I frequently reference back to on the confusions children have in understanding the symbolism of algebra when starting out.
